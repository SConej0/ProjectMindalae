        <h1>Our Purpose</h1>
        <p class="fs-4 text-center">
          This project is part of King County Communities of Opportunity's grant project that looked at the resilience of the Pueblo's Originarios Coalition during the pandemic. After 78 interviews, representing  3 different communities, this project was created in response to the Kichwa-Otavalo Community. The Kichwa-Otavalo Community primarily consists of small business owners who travel to fairs to sell their products or play traditional Andes music at festivals. While this community are experts with the work they do in person, the pandemic highlighted a tech skill gap on the integration of technology into their work.
        <p class="fs-4 text-center">
          Furthermore, the integration of e-commerce with the Metaverse highlights the skill gap needed to stay profitable in the open market of today. The question that remains is how will small businesses, that can’t afford to participate in such spaces be affected? More specifically, immigrant parents that focused on surviving and didn’t have the time or tools to gain the relevant technical knowledge.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-4 text-center">
          There is a lot of information about e-commerce online and loads of website builders. However, there lies the problem, there are too many options. Additionally, to a newer generation using a search engine is second nature, but after over a years work with different BIPOC communities, it is not second nature to everyone and most don’t have the time to look for the correct resources. To start addressing this, this project focuses on, making it easier for the Kichwa community and BIPOC business owners alike to expand their business onto an online platform, by creating a hub spot where e-commerce related information is accessible in Spanish & English.

          <p class="text-center text-large">
            By giving small business owners the tools to start a website, we hope to empower them and close the technological skills gap around e-commerce. We know that it won't happen over night, but we hope that they feel empowered and their websites become another sustainable form of income for them and their families.
