            Setting up a website consists of getting a
            <strong>domain</strong> and <strong>hosting server</strong>. Putting
            these two together, gives you a place to create your website and
            publish it for people to find. The <strong>domain</strong> will be
            the name of your website, "business.com or .net, etc.". The
            <strong>hosting server</strong> will be where you can build the
            website.

          <p>
            A <strong>domain</strong> is the name of your website, this can be
            sold separately from the hosting server company you use. Other
            times, you can buy your domain (a.k.a. website name) through the
            same server company. A domain can either end in .net, .com, .org or
            others, depending on what you want. These different endings have
            different pricings, depending on where you buy them from. Make sure
            it is one you really like and your customers will be able to find
            easily or remember.
            </p>
            <p>A <strong>hosting service</strong> is the
            site that stores all your data, also known as everything you will
            put into the website from text to merchandise. A hosting site will
            literally be hosting you. Think of it as a space you rent for your
            store. That is why when you combine the domain and hosting site,
            it is like the domain is your business sign and the hosting site is
            your store, and now you can start to design the website.
            </p>
            <p> 
            As for pricing, according to WebsiteBuilderExpert, prices can range
            from $2.49 – $13.95/month for <strong>shared hosting</strong> and
            $80 – $506/month for <strong>dedicated hosting</strong>.
            <p>
            The difference between the two hosting options is,
            <strong>dedicated hosting</strong> is more secure than
            <strong>shared hosting</strong> since it is not on a shared server
            like shared hosting is. It is on its own server. From a user’s
              perspective, loading a website on a <strong>dedicated hosting</strong> server is
            faster.

            In order for customers to contact you or carry out other actions
            under the business, a business/brand email is very important. Make
            sure it contains your business name in it, for example,
            "businessname@gmail.com".It keeps you organized by separating
            personal email from business email. Each website builder like Wix,
            Square, etc, has different package levels where you can check
            whether they provide a custom email. There are also email campaigns
            that are an add-on.

            One of the biggest tips I can give from experience is, just do it.
            Creating a website and dealing with technology can be daunting and
            can sound like a lot. But if you truly feel like it is time and it
            is what you want to do. Do it. Take it step by step and enjoy the
            process. It is going to be hard work but it will also be fun.
          </p>
          <p class=""textCenter>
            Marketing is very important for the success of your business aside
            from attending festivals. If you do it well and long enough,
            marketing can increase your sales. It allows your website to be like
            another booth/store. The key here is to be consistent and get
            strategic and creative, but above all consistent since it will take
            time.
          </p>
          <p class=""textCenter>
            Some thing to consider is, really get to know your audience and
            think about who they are. This will help you relate and cater more
            to your customers in the design and marketing of your website.
          </p>
          <p class=""textCenter>
            Take photos of products before you publish your website so you can
            bulk upload them onto the website instead of going back and forth.
          </p>
          <p class=""textCenter>
            An AI copywriting software like CopyAI can help you write your
            marketing content, but make sure your business' voice is coming
            through.
