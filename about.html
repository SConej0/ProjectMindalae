        <p class="content-text">
          This project is part of King County Communities of Opportunity's grant project on the resilience of the Pueblo's Originarios Coalition during the pandemic as deliverable 3.3. After interviewing 20 people representing 20 different Kichwa-Otavalo households, it was observed that all of their businesses were affected during the pandemic due to the nature of their work. Which consists of traveling to fairs to sell their products or playing traditional Andes music at festivals. While this community has run their businesses in person for years, the pandemic highlighted a tech skill gap on how they integrate technology into their work. The combination of e-commerce in the Metaverse highlights the skill gap needed to stay profitable in the open market of today. The question that remains is how will small businesses, that can’t afford to participate in such spaces be affected? More specifically, immigrant parents that focused on surviving and didn’t have the time or tools to gain the relevant knowledge like our most recent generation.

          There is a lot of information about e-commerce online and loads of website builders. However, there lies the problem, there are too many options. To a newer generation using a search engine is second nature, but after over a years work with different BIPOC communities, it isn't second nature to everyone and most don’t have the time. To start addressing this, this project focuses on, how do we support and make it easier for the Kichwa community and BIPOC business owners alike to expand their business onto an online platform? For that reason, a hub spot where this information is accessible in Spanish & English, easy to access, navigate and updated with basic e-commerce information is important.

          <p>
            By giving small business owners the tools to start a website, we hope to empower them and close the technological skills gap around e-commerce. We know that it won't happen over night, but we hope that they feel empowered and their websites become another sustainable form of income for them and their families.
